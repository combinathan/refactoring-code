# Refactoring Code

## Description

Organized and detailed sections of HTML and CSS code for a functioning website. The Horiseon website was already functional before any work was done on it however it needed some minor adjustments to ensure that website operation had minimal errors or had placeholders in the case of operational error. I added some alt text for images and icons in the case that they did not load with the website. Comments were added to describe each section of code and briefly describe what the code does.

## Installation
